# Health Insurance Prediction

This is a machine learning project developed as part of the MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Porto. The goal is to predict whether customers have health insurance based on demographic and socioeconomic data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer-level features such as:
- Age
- Income
- Employment status
- Housing information
- Vehicle ownership

The data was preprocessed, explored using visualizations, and used to train several classification models.

## Methods

Models tested:
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (Linear and RBF)
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost)

Techniques used:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cross-Validation
- F1 Score evaluation

## Technologies

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
