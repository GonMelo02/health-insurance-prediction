# Health Insurance Prediction

This machine learning project was developed as part of the MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Porto.  
Its main objective is to build a predictive model that determines whether a customer has health insurance, using demographic, socioeconomic, and housing-related data.

The project simulates a real-world business scenario and covers the complete data science workflow â€” from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model development, evaluation, and result interpretation. It also aims to compare the behavior and performance of different supervised learning algorithms under varying conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer-level features such as:
- Age
- Income
- Employment status
- Housing information
- Vehicle ownership

The data was preprocessed, explored using visualizations, and used to train several classification models.

## Methods

Models tested:
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (Linear and RBF)
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost)

Techniques used:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cross-Validation
- F1 Score evaluation

## Technologies

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
